          <h3>The Dual Dimension – Album Cover / Vinyl Record</h3>
          <p class="date"> May 2025 </p>
          <p>This is a vinyl record design I created as a personal project, inspired by themes of duality and contrast. two human silhouettes form a yin-yang shape, representing balance and connection.

The record label design is clean and minimal to contrast with the busy cover, keeping the focus on the music and track list. I aimed to blend retro vinyl vibes with a modern graphic style.</p>

          <h3>ROAM Magazine – Social Media Content </h3>
          <p class="date"> February 2025 </p>
          <p>This is a concept project for ROAM Magazine, a made-up publication focused on van life, road adventures, and DIY living. I designed a series of Instagram posts to promote an issue of the magazine, 
I wanted the visuals to feel warm, adventurous, and down-to-earth just like the stories themselves. I used a topographic map pattern in the background, earthy colors, and clean, bold typography to keep everything consistent and easy to follow. The goal was to create a scroll-worthy, on-brand social media presence.</p>

          <p class="date"> July 2024 </p>
          <p>A responsive email design concept for a fictional wellness brand, The Crystal Ball. The goal was to promote a new crystal roller series with a soft, calming aesthetic. I designed both desktop and mobile versions, focusing on clean layout, soothing visuals, and a clear path to shop.</p>
